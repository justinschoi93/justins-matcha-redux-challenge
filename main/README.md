## Description
The challenge was to refactor an E-Commerce Platform so that it nolonger relied on React's Context API and instead implemented a Redux Store. 

## Learning Experience
It was a great opportunity to practice using Redux Store, as well as it's associated methods to not have to seperately define a store and context.
